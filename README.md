## day by day

### Mar 24, 2024

i lost my phone yesterday -- i am not happy. anyway ive mostly been working on html elements I havent before besides the basic structure. 

```flex-box``` will always confuse me and google will always be my friend

worked with SVGs for the monogram which was fun, I saw a [tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/SVG_and_CSS) that could make svgs interactive which I want to take a look into for [travel-tanzania](https://github.com/n-buckley/travel-tanzania)

also I'm finally working with ```@screen``` responsiveness which is damn annoying LOL 

I am also really inspired by [Nandini Ghosh](https://nandinighosh.wixsite.com/nandinighosh/about), one of the presenters. Her website is ridiculously awesome and definitely makes me want to think and learn more about design and fonts :) 

im in the middle of implementing [dark/light themse](https://lukelowrey.com/css-variable-theme-switcher/). I still want the switch in thesmes to change a couple other elemsnt - not just colors. For example the tooltip, images on screen, etc

I think it would be fun to also once im happy w the html ive learned convert it into react

I also want to go back and work on the [Girl Math](https://www.github.com/n-buckley/hack-the-patriarchy) tool
